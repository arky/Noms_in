	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
    <p>From nanotechnology to oyster farming, Boston is known to geek out on pretty much everything. In-house butchering, Fernet-Branca and handmade burrata are familiar sights; Boston can even boast its very own bean-to-bar chocolate factory (take that, Monsieur Wonka). The city is ferociously walkable, with clusters of neighborhoods defined by respective townie roots, the new-school influx, and next generations of the eagerly hungry. Go on and make history.</p>

          <p>Toro
1704 Washington Street
Boston, MA
United States<br>
toro-restaurant.com</p>
	      <p>Perhaps the best way to encapsulate Toro, Ken Oringer's and Jamie Bissonette's Spanish small-plates lovechild, is simply to describe events that befall under the steely, watchful eye of the wall-mounted namesake bull: A never-ending crush of happy, oil-slicked, uni-lapping diners on all sides of the wooden communal table. Tripe stew, veal sweetbreads, dewy salads - an endless sequence of small gems sailing out of the kerchief-studded open kitchen. At the insistently carefree bar, an inky Tempranillo splashed into a glass tumbler; a "Saicar" thrust to your lips. And despite the beef heart, foie gras and mighty variants on pig parts strewn freely about the menu, Toro is a sleeper vegan-friendly spot (the cauliflower a la plancha elevates the dorkiest cruciferous vegetable to foodgasmic heights). </p>

233 Cardinal Medeiros Avenue
Cambridge, MA
United States<br>
hungrymothercambridge.com</p>
<p>
Boiled peanuts, salty-soft nibbles. Blackened little curlicues of tobacco onions. Pimiento cheese sandwiches tempered by dainty celery sticks and a fried pickled okra that nary got away. This tiny refuge for Southern-swayed appetites is a local obsession with its quietly genius beverage program, gratifying late-night menu until 12:30am, and mismatched dishes for kicks-grandma's-ass desserts (whatever it is, get it à la mode). If you’re tucking in for a serious dinner, reservations are wise; but we find that securing seats at the tiny bar is worth the gamble.

528 Commonwealth Avenue
Boston, MA

easternstandardboston.com</p>


<p>
Bespectacled, vest-clad, pomade-slicked bar manager Jackson Cannon wrote the book on classic cocktails in Boston; he also probably letter-pressed, hand-stitched, and leather-bound it as well. Eastern Standard's drink menu reads like a restored artifact, straightforward and surreptitious in its thematics (Standards, Sparklers, Table-Sized, Tiki-isms, Mocktails, (c) and employing house-made infusions, syrups, bitters, elixirs. Of the many excellent cocktail geeks' options in Boston, Eastern Standard is worth a tipple—for the impressive cross-section of guests (it is in a hotel, after all), a perfectly graze-able brasserie menu, and a serious industry contingency (can you smell the Fernet?).

<p>With its deft orchestration of Mediterranean and Turkish-influenced spices, Oleana warms you from the belly out. Dishes are opulent and layered with complexity (and incidentally, most are vegetarian-friendly)—from pomegranate spoon salad, draped with gigante beans and fried shishito peppers, to the much beloved baked alaska (we suspect there’s a fan club). The Eden-esque patio, a cocoon from Cambridge's stirrings, is sensually lush with flora and de rigueur in summer months.</p>

<p>Pockmarked with all things tasty and sketchy, Allston is like that loyal, slobbery dog that's ugly as hell while remaining unflinchingly indispensable. That said, Deep Ellum is a diamond in the rough, a beer lover's gastropub with an embarrassment of riches, including: the coolest and most unusual local brews on tap, a curated bottle list spanning a Swedish farmhouse lager to a large-format Dutch stout made from a historic London recipe, and fearless dishes like truffled Gorgonzola fries or the housemade "best wurst plate." You will spend lots of money on awesome beer here; it will be glorious and it will be good.

69 Church Street
Bay Village
Boston, MA 02116-5418
United States
erbaluce-boston.com

</p>
Erbaluce is a downtown gem, a mystical 5-minute walk away from wherever you seem to be, yet tucked away from the madding crowds just so. Drink gorgeously off-the-radar wine, delight in candlelit company, and be stupefied by simple pleasures like unctuous veal ribs or brightly sweet wild Maine shrimp. The flavors are comforting and unexpected at once, as chef (and dry wit) Charles Draghi creates an Italian tour de force that squeezes every type of pleasure out of exactingly sourced ingredients.

</p>
<p>If you haven't learned by now, Boston loves it some ice cream; Toscanini's is ne plus ultra of micro-batch ice creameries. If the sheer list of 40+ flavors doesn't knock you over (burnt caramel, rather dark chocolate, blueberry pancake, c), the intensely rich mouthfeel surely will. Charmingly unglamorous, the ice cream kitchen is visible behind the counter and from the sidewalk (behind huge windows). If you're taking your scoop out for a stroll, cross the street and hit Central Bottle, the platonic ideal of a modern neighborhood wine and cheese store. (Mind the Vespa.)  </p>

Distractingly adorable husband-and-wife team of Christopher Myers and Joanne Chang (of wicked-good Flour Bakery - it's right down the street) give you hokey-fake Confucianisms and blasting rock-and-roll along with delicious turns on Asian classics like dan-dan noodles, banh mi or pork dumpling potstickers (à la Mama Chang). The well-seasoned woks (you can see them firing) each have their distinctive "hay" if you pay super close attention. Go for lunch, as it's just as fun and way less stressful than during the dinner crunch. </p>

<p>The North End is notorious for a lot of things, but Neptune Oyster is a delightful exception to the touristy, overpriced rule. Diminutive, unassuming, and diva-free, this tile-and-mirror-lined paean to la mer serves the most simple, most fresh, and most inspired seafood in the city. Oysters are a must, with over a dozen varieties dotting the sweet-briny spectrum. You can slum it in luxury with the best-ever lobster roll or a burger topped with perfect fried oysters, or take a spin with the plats du jour plus local farm and crudo specials. </p>

<p> Yes, there's mind-blowing handmade pasta and precious salads and altogether scrumptious savories at Sportello, Barbara Lynch's ode to Italian lunch counters - but the retail bakery nook deserves full due. Primly organized in fanciful domed plates and stacked on glass, pastries tempt with fresh-baked wonder: wonderful macarons, spiced donuts, flaky croissants, or cookies and tarts laced with fleur de sel and herbs. Though admittedly there are cupcakes for sale (crème fraiche with peanut butter frosting, say), foofy trend-killing cafe this ain't. </p>

Ratchadamnoen Rd
Chiang Mai

<p>Sunday evenings around 5pm, Ratchadamnoen Road in Chiang Mai's "Old City" is closed to traffic and turns into a half-mile long mosh-pit of tourists and Thais, shopping for art and handicrafts and eating their way through night. The grounds of three different Buddhist temples along the street are converted into food courts. My favorite is Wat Muen Lan, nearest to Thapae Gate. Walk into the court, and you'll see twin mortar and pestles pounding out the cold explosion of flavor that is som tam, green papaya salad. Further back and to the right are a couple of tables where you can get khanom jeen, ground pork and rice vermicelli in a salty tomato broth, and khao soi, the iconic mixed-up and comforting soup of the north. Head all the way back and you'll find a grill loaded with "moo toop" - pinkish, candied-looking hunks of pork. Select a piece, and they'll give it a beating with a mallet, cleav it into bite-size pieces and pour a tart and spicy sauce over it. The som tam pairs well, as would a beer if you could get one: You're on temple grounds, so you'll have to settle for water or juice!  </p>

This is mukata.</p>

<p>There are several large mukata places in Chiang Mai. The biggest is behind the Hillside Plaza on Huay Kaew. The entrance is the just to the right of the Hillside Plaza, down a long driveway. Any tuk-tuk driver will be able to take you there as well.

<p>Sure, you can get a wing at carts all over town, but this place grills it up by the half bird, and it's so tasty you *want* it in bulk. The som tam is fresh, crisp, cold and not so spicy that your palate is seared. They close early - once we got there at 20:30 and the grill was already cold. The address is for Chiang Mai Ram hospital. Facing the hospital, walk left for about 100 yards - it's the bit entryway just past the 7-11.

You might wait a bit regardless of when you go, but it'll be worth it - the selection of Lanna (northern Thai) food is fantastic. The nam prik moo (crispy pork chili paste) is a great combination of heat and sweet. The Burmese pork curry is a succulent experience of silk and cinnamon, with large chunks of tender pork hanging off the bone. </p>

      </div>
	  <div data-role="content"> 
<p>My experience of New Orleans is that it's a city of too much; too much booze-soaked music, too much rich food, too much humidity, too much sorrow. It's a city very much in the South but with an identity unlike anywhere else. I've never been in a city inside the United States that felt so little a part of it. It's a mixture of the elegance of Europe with the broken infrastructure of some communist backwater. Moss-draped boulevards lined with ornate mansions have potholes deep enough to lose a tire. Get there quick before sand and sea swallow it whole.</p>

"The other white meat" may be most denigrating description of pork ever. It boggles the mind that such obfuscation and chicanery was used to sell the most versatile and succulent of meats. Thankfully, among the gourmets, gourmands, and gluttons the sweet blob of pink on four cloven hoofs has never gone out of fashion. Cochon is Chef Donald Link's salute to those who consume swine from snout to tail, less the oink. The cuisine can be best described as high Cajun and all of southern Louisiana critters make an appearance on the menu at one point in time or another. This is a place to indulge yourself in New Orleans unofficial moto, "have another," whether it be another piece of head cheese, a bite of pickled watermellon rind, or two fingers worth of any of the fine whiskeys they stock. </p>

<p>Luke is by far the least wanky restaurant inside a Hilton Hotel I've ever been to.

Now that you're an adult, live the delusion. The belt driven fans, vintage tile and newspaper racks are just like the real thing, and the waiters at Luke are friendlier than those found in Montmatre. The charcuterie is varied and not to be missed, as is the happy hour where oysters are 50 cents and drinks half off. Two dozen on the half shell and at least three French 75's and you'll be well on your way to forgetting the pain of staying home that semester so you could finish up that minor in mathematics. </p>

Of course, it helps that chefs can tap into a year-round growing season and nearly 375 organic farms in the county to support them.

<p>Go on and toss your seafood pocket guide aside. The Fishery in San Diego’s Pacific Beach neighborhood is a sustainable seafood oasis. While too many restaurants are all talk when it comes to sourcing their fish thoughtfully, this vibrant spot takes it to the plate in the form of locally-caught swordfish nestled in roasted sweet potato purée, local spinach, bacon and hedgehog mushroom sauce; grilled local spiny lobster, or old-school Louis make from freshly picked Dungeness crab and flavor-packed Oregon pink shrimp. The sourcing here is spot-on. Of course it helps that fisherman-turned-owner Judd Brown’s other business is seafood wholesale company, Pacific Shellfish. That means chef Paul Arias gets the primo pickings from the day's catch. Check-out the to-go seafood counter for treats like smoked line-caught ahi tuna or rocky mounds of briny fresh oysters. Oh, and that big photo on the wall of Judd landing a monster-sized toothy mako shark? That’s for reals, people. </p>

You can’t go wrong. Salads here are crisp, fresh and dressed in their luncheon best. In fact, some of those tender young nibbles come from Point Loma Farm -- mere blocks from the restaurant. The housemade charcuterie is a crafted by part-owner Pete Balisteri himself, who lures you with savory tasties like duck prosciutto, finocchiona, pancetta, or the oh-so-good citrus salami. Heads-up on saving room for dessert. Skillful pastry chef Sue Brandenburg takes full advantage of area’s fruit production. It’s a never ending rotation that moves from cara cara oranges and limequats to delicate berries, plump figs, juicy plums, sweet pears and more. Her salted white chocolate oatmeal cookies are keepers too. </p>

Knowledgeable bar staff pour creative house-infused cocktails including a bevy of Bourbon and gin drinks that we’re certain Don Draper would tipple. Poolside cabana seating is the primo spot on Wednesday “Dive-in” nights, where classic movies flicker on the outdoor screen. Chef Aaron Lamont turns out a tempting array of flavor packed dishes. The house-made bacon gets wrapped around black tiger shrimp; pork confit is topped with crispy onions, and a mouthwateringly good burger is the result of Lamont grinding the beef himself to ensure juiciness that only comes from the correct fat-to-meat ratio. Snag a seat on the shag-carpet section and challenge your date to an after-dinner game of Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots or other retro games. </p>

      <h3>Cocktails at Craft & Commerce</h3>
      <p>675 W. Beech Street, San Diego, CA, 92101 craft-commerce.com</p>
      <p>Craft & Commerce brings an East Coast swagger to this West Coast outpost with a superbly-designed and executed cocktail program guaranteed to make your inner-cocktailian swoon. The drink-list may showcase up to 20 tasty beverages but their compendium is 400 cocktails deep. This is the place to order that gin flip, pisco sour or whiskey smash you’ve always wanted to try but lacked a bartender with know-how. Bring extra friends and order a punchbowl instead. Gin, Bourbon or rum-based punch is meant for sharing, and served out of lovely vintage glassware. The food menu flaunts a whimsy side as well. Add your name to the chalkboard list near the door to snag a table, and then sample the bacon Cracker Jacks, devils on horseback or mini-corndogs nibbles. Need something more substantial to soak up the boozy goodness you’re imbibing? They’ve got you covered there too. Check out the crispy, flavor-packed fried chicken, tender smoked brisket sandwich or homey mac and cheese made with aged cheddar, gruyere and wild mushrooms. </p>

      <h3>Breakfast at Coffee Cup</h3>
      <p>1109 Wall St., La Jolla, CA, 92037 isabelscantina.com</p>
      <p>This is everything you want in a breakfast joint. Small but bustling. Neighborhoody. Hip. Best bet is to come here with a friend, rather than a group. Plenty of two-tops, busy servers, and strong coffee will perk you up in no time. While they do serve lunch, breakfast is where this place shines. Breakfast tamales, covered in tomatillo sauce and served with scrambled eggs and black beans are a winner; while blackberry banana pancakes (with added bacon on the side, of course) hit our sweet spot. Order an extra plate side of the signature crispy rosemary potatoes. They’re delightful, and you won’t want to share. And when you’re done noshing, take a short walk down to La Jolla Cove and burn off that extra helping of maple syrup we saw you sneaking. </p>

You'll find fish mongers tossing today's catch, while vendors man their stands selling handmade jewelry, local produce and flowers. But the real treat is the plethora of shops offering fresh-made noms. The aroma from the Daily Dozen Doughnuts stand will draw you in like a magnet, you can taste the goods at Beecher's Handmade Cheese while watching the cheesemakers at work, and the Russian bakery Piroshky-Piroshky serves up their savory namesake stuffed with beef and onions. Sure, it's a tourist destination, but it's one place you simply won't mind being a tourist yourself! </p>

It serves up all sorts of French deliciousness, from the aforementioned to a roasted rack of lamb with a hearty mustard crust, to duck confit sauteed with savoy and cabbage, to roasted veal sweetbreads.

The chowder has a wonderful creaminess, well cooked potatoes but not a mashed potato texture, a solid punch of thyme, and plenty of clams. As if the chowder wasn’t good enough, the crab cakes are legendary. Cooked to order and served only at the top of the hour in very limited quantities, these crab cakes contain nothing but crab meat, spices, and a little bit of bell pepper and onion. No fillers, no béchamel, just fresh crab meat cakes. Get there early or wait another hour strolling around Spud Point, either way you won’t be disappointed. </p>

If you’d rather have lunch, that’s fine, the brick oven does double-duty each day, turning out high-quality pizza in the afternoon. Grab a scone, a dark roasted coffee and enjoy the wind-swept Sonoma Coast. </p>

    <h1>Vancouver</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
  <p>You only need to be in Vancouver for 1 hour in the summer and you’ll be ready to move there. Waterways define neighborhood borders, beaches crawl up to city streets, bikers pedal and kayakers paddle their way around town. But it’s the clean air and delicate conifer aromas, with pockets of wafting garlic frying in Chinese woks, beef short ribs sizzling in Korean barbecues, and shrimp tempura smoking from Japanese izakayas that will win your heart.</p>

        <h3>Granville Island Public Market</h3>
        <p>Granville Island Public Market
1661 Duranleau St
Vancouver, BC
Canada
granvilleisland.com
</p>
<p>Spend a late morning or early afternoon winding through the aisles of local fruits, vegetables and meats in the markets on Granville Island. Sure, it's a touristy thing to do... but in that vein, grab some bites, sit outside and listen to live music while watching the boats pass by. And while you're there, keep a nose out for the sausages at Oyama, and the pot pies at A la Mode. </p>

        <h3>Indian Dinner at Vij's</h3>
        <p>Vij's
1480 W 11th Ave
Vancouver, BC
Canada
vijs.ca</p>
<p>Vij's doesn't take reservations, and you could wait up to 2 hours to get a table. But the moment you walk in the door and your nostrils widen to the spiced curried aromas meandering through the air, you know the wait will be worth it. Start with the Punjabi heart attack, a spoonful of sweet and spicy cashews, then migrate to the date masala chickpeas atop a bed of grilled kale, and finish with the grilled lamb popsicles in fenugreek cream curry. </p>

        <h3>Brunch at Medina Cafe</h3>
        <p>Medina Cafe
556 Beatty Street
Vancouver, BC
Canada
medinacafe.com</p>
<p>Let me just run through part of the brunch menu: Tagine, saumon fume, fricassé, cassoulet and Belgian waffles. Typically, restaurants that cover a spread of multi-national dishes put out dishes that get me to elicit a half-hearted, "Meh." However, I've tasted 4 of Medina's brunch dishes, and every single one was perfectly executed. The most memorable was perhaps the fricassé - braised short ribs, caramelized onions, arugula and applewood cheddar topped with 2 fried eggs and delivered to the table in an iron skillet. Nomnomnom. </p>

        <h3>Street Snacks at Japa Dog</h3>
        <p>Japa Dog
899 Burrard Street
Vancouver, BC
Canada
japadog.com</p>
<p>A lot of "fusion" food is comprised of ill thought-out novelty combinations that just don't cut the mustard. Japa Dog cuts it alright, but they serve it up with wasabi mayo instead. This Japan-ized hot dog stand in downtown Vancouver serves high-quality beef and pork dogs with a slew of toppings, most of which you'd recognize from your local sushi joint. The Oroshi is a peppery and tangy affair: a brat topped with cold grated radish, finely chopped spring onion, and a sweet-salty soy sauce. The Okonomi is the big pig though: silky Kurobuta pork, thinly sliced sauteed napa cabbage, wasabi mayo, okonomiyaki sauce and topped with a fluffy mound of bonito flake. There's even more at the stand, and you can mash them up any which way, and there's even a veggie dog available. </p>

        <h3>Drinking Foods at Guu Izakaya</h3>
        <p>Guu Izakaya
375 Water St
Vancouver, BC
Canada
guu-izakaya.com</p>
<p>Sure, you're not in Tokyo, but Guu still feels like a real izakaya in a couple of important ways: just after work it's always loud, always full, and it all goes great with beer. The menu has pub basics like edamame, agadashi tofu, tuna tataki, but then it twists and gives you creations like kabocha-krokke, a ball of kabocha pumpkin wrapped around a hard-boiled egg, battered and deep-fried - a Japanese/Scotch-egg if you will. While the grill menu doesn't have the usual izakaya stand-bys, it is solid enough with ton-taro, grilled pork cheek, with black pepper standing it up, and a beef tongue steak that is so so tender. Guu's got Asahi and Kirin on draft, and a whole bunch of shochu options if you had a rough day at the office and need to get properly schnockered. </p>
